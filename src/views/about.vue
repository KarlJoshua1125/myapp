          country’s premier technological, engineering, and computing higher
          educational institutions. It is a private non-sectarian stock school
          founded on February 8, 1962 by a group of educators headed by Engineer
          Demetrio A. Quirino, Jr. and Dr. Teresita U. Quirino. Using an
          outcomes-based educational model with its locally and globally
          accredited programs, T.I.P. allows students to acquire
          industry-desired qualities and essential experiences that better equip
          them to be effective as soon as they enter the workforce or set up
          their own business. Engr. Demetrio A. Quirino Jr. T.I.P. Founder Dr.
          Teresita U. Quirino T.I.P. Founder T.I.P. laid down its objective
          based on its founders’ vision: 1) to maintain high standards of

          of higher education; and 3) to cooperate with the government in the
          implementation of its economic and social amelioration programs. The
          school committed itself to educating and developing men and women who

          offering of courses included Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering,
