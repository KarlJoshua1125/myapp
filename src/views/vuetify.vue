    <h1> What is Vuetify? </h1>
    <p>
     Vuetify is a complete UI framework built on top of
      Vue.js. The goal of the project is to provide developers with the tools
      they need to build rich and engaging user experiences. Unlike other
      frameworks, Vuetify is designed from the ground up to be easy to learn and
      rewarding to master with hundreds of carefully crafted components from the
      Material Design specification. Vuetify takes a mobile first approach to
      design which means your application just works out of the box—whether it’s
      on a phone, tablet, or desktop computer. If you are an experienced
      developer and want to compare Vuetify to other libraries/frameworks, check
      out our Vue Framework Comparison Chart. #Why Vuetify? Since its initial
      release in 2014, Vue.js has grown to be one of the most popular JavaScript
      frameworks in the world. One of the reasons for this popularity is the
      wide use of components which enable developers to create concise modules
      to be used and re-used throughout their application. UI Libraries are
      collections of these modules that implement a specific style guideline and
      provide the necessary tools to build expansive web applications. Vuetify
      is developed exactly according to Material Design specification with every
      component meticulously crafted to be modular, responsive, and performant.
      Customize your application with unique and dynamic Layouts and customize
      the styles of your components using SASS variables. Vuetify has a very
      active development cycle and is patched weekly, responding to community
      issues and reports at breakneck speed, allowing you to get your hands on
      bug fixes and enhancements more often. In addition, every major release is
      accompanied with 18 months of Long-term support for the previous minor
      version. Unlike other frameworks, when you develop with Vuetify, you are
      never alone. Stuck on a problem? Take advantage of our massive Discord
