    <h1>What is Composition API</h1>
    <p>
      Composition API is a built-in feature of Vue 3 and Vue 2.7. For older Vue
      2 versions, use the officially maintained @vue/composition-api plugin. In
      Vue 3, it is also primarily used together with the syntax in Single-File
      Components.Better Logic Reuse#
The primary advantage of Composition API is that it enables clean, efficient logic reuse in the form of Composable functions. It solves all the drawbacks of mixins, the primary logic reuse mechanism for Options API.

Composition API's logic reuse capability has given rise to impressive community projects such as VueUse, an ever-growing collection of composable utilities. It also serves as a clean mechanism for easily integrating stateful third-party services or libraries into Vue's reactivity system, for example immutable data, state machines, and RxJS.W
